                    <p class="text-white">Before you implement a sales enablement processes, you need to first construct clear definitions for the sales journeys for your products, services and solutions. Any sales enablement strategy needs to be plotted against these journeys to make sure they’re the right fit for your business.</p>

                    <p class="text-white">Each of these personas will be motivated in different ways, depending on the impact of the purchase decision on their specific day-to-day. Architect your content to make sure the right type of content goes to the most relevant person. For example; technical specs may be of relevance to the day-to-day users of a product and their department heads, whereas the C-suite may be more interested in overall business impact.</p>

                    <p class="text-white">Messaging and assets which work best for rational thinkers revolve around stats, facts and hard proof.  Emotional thinkers are more likely to connect with customer stories and conversations around specific needs or challenges.</p>
